white-express-passport-app
==========================

White application with boilerplate code for login + logout process with express and passport 

Mostly inspired by  from https://github.com/madhums/nodejs-express-mongoose-demo.git

However, lot of code has been  lean-ified (i.e. removed) in order to have only the minimum ready-to-start application


**Note:** You need to have node.js and mongodb installed and running

## Install
```sh
  $ git clone git://github.com/davidb583/white-express-passport-app.git
  $ npm install
  $ node app
```
